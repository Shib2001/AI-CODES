# Weather Bot: How It Works

This guide follows one request from the moment you start the app until you see
or hear the weather report. It also explains what the project does **not** have
yet, and gives a practical path for adding caching and databases later.

## 1. Start the app

Open PowerShell in the repository folder and run:

```powershell
cd Weather_bot
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8000> in your browser. The FastAPI server is defined in
[`main.py`](./main.py). It reads the repository-root `.env` file when it starts.
The OpenRouter key should be set as `OPEN_ROUTER=...`. The LLM model,
speech model, voice, host, and port can also be configured there.

The browser page consists of:

- [`index.html`](./index.html): page structure and controls.
- [`style.css`](./style.css): appearance and responsive layout.
- [`script.js`](./script.js): browser behavior, speech recognition, and API calls.

FastAPI serves these files and the API from the same origin. Its automatically
generated API documentation is at <http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs>.

## 2. Text search: end-to-end flow

For example, the user types:

> What is the weather for Noida today?

### Step 1: The browser sends the question

The form submit handler in [`script.js`](./script.js) sends a JSON request:

```http
POST /api/weather
Content-Type: application/json

{"query":"What is the weather for Noida today?"}
```

The browser does **not** call Open-Meteo or OpenRouter directly. Those requests
are made by the backend, so the OpenRouter key stays on the server.

### Step 2: FastAPI validates the request

The `/api/weather` endpoint in [`main.py`](./main.py) validates the JSON using
the `WeatherRequest` Pydantic model. It accepts a natural-language `query`; the
older `city` field is also still accepted for compatibility.

Invalid or missing input is rejected with a validation response (usually HTTP
422). The endpoint then calls `fetch_weather(query)`.

### Step 3: The backend extracts the place and requested day

`parse_weather_question()` removes common question wording and identifies
whether the user asked about today, tomorrow, or a rainy/monsoon season.

Examples:

| User's wording | Place extracted | Requested data |
|---|---|---|
| `What is the weather for Noida today?` | Noida | Current conditions and today's high/low |
| `How is the weather in Lisbon tomorrow?` | Lisbon | Tomorrow's forecast |
| `Is rainy season going on in Kerala?` | Kerala | Current conditions plus historical rainfall context |

Kashmir is represented using Srinagar as a regional reference point. Kerala is
represented by a central point in the state. Regional weather varies, so these
are estimates rather than reports for every place in the region.

### Step 4: The backend gets weather data from Open-Meteo

For ordinary city names, `fetch_weather()` makes these server-side requests:

1. **Geocoding** finds a place name and its latitude/longitude:
   `https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/v1/search`
2. **Forecast** uses those coordinates to get current and daily measurements:
   `https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast`

For rainy-season questions, it also requests historical daily precipitation:

3. **Historical archive**:
   `https://archive-api.open-meteo.com/v1/archive`

The backend converts the weather code to a readable condition and builds a
weather-data object containing the location, date, condition, temperatures,
precipitation, and other available measurements.

### Step 5: OpenRouter writes the text report (TTT)

`create_weather_report()` sends the question and verified weather-data object
to OpenRouter's chat-completions API:

```text
POST https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions
```

The system prompt tells the model to answer only weather questions, use the
provided measurements, handle today/tomorrow/season questions appropriately,
and return a short, gentle answer rather than its analysis.

The backend also disables reasoning output and runs `clean_weather_report()` on
the model's answer so an analysis block is not shown as the weather report.

If OpenRouter returns no usable text, `create_fallback_report()` builds a
simple report directly from the weather measurements instead. That avoids
failing the weather endpoint just because the model returned an empty answer.

### Step 6: The browser displays the result

The backend responds with JSON similar to:

```json
{
  "weather": {
    "location": "Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India",
    "condition": "clear sky",
    "temperature_c": 25.5
  },
  "report": "Today in Noida, it is clear..."
}
```

The response contains more weather fields than this shortened example.
`script.js` puts the report in the report card and the measurements in the
weather-detail cards. The frontend uses text content, not HTML from the model.

## 3. Voice search: STT → weather → TTT → TTS

The microphone button uses the browser's Web Speech
`SpeechRecognition`/`webkitSpeechRecognition` API.

1. **STT — speech to text:** The browser listens to the user and transcribes the
   spoken question. For example, “What's the weather in Lisbon tomorrow?”
2. **Same weather request:** The transcript is put into the search box and the
   normal form submit runs. It sends the transcript to `POST /api/weather`.
3. **Weather lookup:** The backend extracts the place/date and calls Open-Meteo,
   just as it does for typed text.
4. **TTT — text to text:** OpenRouter creates the report, or the backend uses its
   data-based fallback.
5. **TTS — text to speech:** The user clicks **Listen to report**. The browser
   sends the displayed report text to `POST /api/speech`.
6. The FastAPI speech endpoint sends the text to OpenRouter's TTS API:
   `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/audio/speech`
7. With the default HeyGen model, the backend requests PCM audio, wraps it in a
   WAV container, and returns it as `audio/wav`. The browser plays the returned
   audio.

So the microphone performs **STT in the browser**, not in FastAPI. The weather
lookup and report are performed on the backend. TTS happens only after the user
presses the listen button; it is not automatically played after every search.
Speech recognition availability and microphone permissions depend on the
browser.

## 4. What the HTTP status codes mean

- **200:** The endpoint succeeded.
- **422:** FastAPI rejected invalid input, or the requested place could not be
  found.
- **502:** An upstream service such as Open-Meteo or OpenRouter failed or
  returned unusable data.
- **503:** The OpenRouter key is missing or still has the example placeholder.

The weather and speech endpoints are different:

```text
POST /api/weather  -> JSON weather measurements and text report
POST /api/speech   -> audio bytes for the supplied report text
```

Opening either URL in a browser address bar sends a GET request, not the
required POST. Use the page or the **Try it out** controls in `/docs`.

## 5. What is currently stored?

The current Weather Bot does **not** have a database, vector database, or Redis
cache. It fetches weather and historical data on each request. The OpenRouter
key is read from `.env`; there is no user account or search-history storage.

## 6. A practical optimization roadmap

### First: add Redis caching

Redis is the best first addition for repeated questions because weather lookups
and AI/TTS requests happen repeatedly for the same place and conditions.

Use separate cache entries for separate kinds of data:

| Cache entry | Suggested key | Example lifetime |
|---|---|---|
| Geocoding result | `geo:v1:<normalized-place>` | 7–30 days |
| Current weather | `weather:current:v1:<latitude>:<longitude>` | 5–10 minutes |
| Daily forecast | `weather:daily:v1:<latitude>:<longitude>:<date>` | 30–60 minutes |
| Historical rainfall normals | `weather:season:v1:<latitude>:<longitude>` | 30–90 days |
| Generated report | `report:v1:<model>:<weather-data-hash>` | 10–30 minutes |
| Generated speech (optional) | `speech:v1:<model>:<voice>:<text-hash>` | Short; only if reuse justifies storage |

Normalize place names before keying (trim spaces, collapse repeated spaces, and
case-fold). For forecast/report keys, include the coordinates, requested date,
and relevant weather fields. For report keys, also include the model and a
prompt/version string. This avoids returning a stale answer after weather data
or prompt behavior changes.

A typical request flow with Redis would be:

1. Normalize the location and check Redis for its geocoding result.
2. Check Redis for the current/forecast data. On a miss, call Open-Meteo and
   cache the result with a short expiry.
3. Build a stable hash from the normalized question intent and the weather
   fields used in the response. Check Redis for a generated report.
4. On a report-cache miss, call OpenRouter, clean the response, and cache it.
5. If the user asks for speech, check an optional audio cache. Otherwise call
   TTS and return the audio.

The weather data should have its own cache entry; do not cache only the final
LLM response. That way the application can refresh live conditions while still
avoiding duplicate report-generation calls when the underlying measurements
have not changed.

Use a Redis key version such as `v1` so cache formats can be changed safely.
Choose TTLs based on how quickly the data becomes stale. Cache misses must
continue to work if Redis is unavailable, and logs should make cache failures
visible. Do not put API keys or personal information in cache keys.

To add this, install a Redis Python client (for example `redis`), run a Redis
server (locally or a managed Redis service), and put its URL in an environment
variable such as `REDIS_URL`. Add a small cache module with `get_json()` and
`set_json()` helpers, then call those helpers around the existing geocoding,
forecast, history, and report functions. Keep the existing provider functions as
the cache-miss path.

### Second: use a regular database for application records

A **relational database** stores structured records and is useful when the app
needs user accounts, saved locations, preferences, request history, usage
tracking, or administrative reports.

- **SQLite:** simplest for local development or a single-user prototype.
- **PostgreSQL:** a good production default for multiple users and concurrent
  requests.

Possible tables later:

- `users` and `user_preferences` (only if accounts are added).
- `saved_locations`.
- `weather_requests` with normalized location, coordinates, requested date,
  provider, and timestamp.
- `weather_snapshots` if historical results need to be retained.

Redis is a fast, expiring cache; PostgreSQL/SQLite is durable application data.
They solve different problems. Avoid saving every request forever unless the
product needs that history, and define retention rules before storing user data.

### Third: only add a vector database if there is searchable text knowledge

A vector database is **not needed** to answer current weather questions. Live
temperature and precipitation are numeric API results; get them from the
weather API and cache them in Redis.

A vector store becomes useful if the bot must search a collection of text
documents, such as official climate guides, local severe-weather instructions,
or a curated knowledge base. In that case:

1. Collect and verify source documents.
2. Split the text into small passages and attach source/date/region metadata.
3. Create embeddings and store each passage in a vector index.
4. For a relevant question, retrieve matching passages and cite their sources
   in the model prompt.
5. Keep live forecast values coming from Open-Meteo; do not replace them with
   retrieved document text.

Start without a vector database. Add one only when there is a specific
document-search requirement.

## Suggested order

1. Keep the current FastAPI + Open-Meteo + OpenRouter implementation working.
2. Add Redis caching for geocoding, forecasts, and historical rainfall.
3. Add report caching keyed by the weather-data hash, model, and prompt version.
4. Add PostgreSQL only when saved users/locations/history are actually needed.
5. Add a vector database only when the bot needs to search trusted documents.

This order improves speed and cost without adding databases the current app
does not yet need.
